# scraping

This is a simple and trivial example of scraping web pages.

The scraper takes URL and CSS ID selector as input parameters and returns data every second.

To test this please use URL: <https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/poland> and ID: `#ct`. Scraper will connect to the website and read (scrap) the current time. Next, it returns this as a stream.
As URL and ID are parametrized we can use other websites too. For example, URL: <https://time.is/> and ID: `#clock`

> ðŸ’¡ **Please note that the sample below requires some previous installations before you start running it, you will find them [here](../../README.md#3-install-scramjet-transform-hub).**

## Running

Open two terminals and run the following commands:

**The first terminal:**

```bash
# start sth
scramjet-transform-hub
```

**The second terminal**

```bash
# go to 'scraping' directory
cd samples/scraping

# install dependencies
npm install

# transpile TS->JS to dist/
npm run build

# prepare standalone JS package
cp -r node_modules package.json dist/

# make a compressed package with Sequence
si pack dist

# send Sequence to transform hub, this will output Sequence ID
si seq send dist.tar.gz

# start a Sequence, this will output Instance ID. As the CSS ID has # (hash) sign surround it with quotes:
si seq start - https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/poland '#ct'

# See output
si inst output -

# Optional commands below:

# Check console.log messages
si inst stdout -

# Check console.error messages
si inst stderr -
```

## Output

```bash
$ si instance output 41783884-2e97-4b78-9639-aac5d7ff8447
