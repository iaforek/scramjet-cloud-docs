# Templates :pencil:

We have prepared for you some templates. User templates allow you to apply predefined settings to start building your own applications. Using templates, you can easily set up multiple applications with similar settings.

You can use it as a base for your own samples üëâ [sample template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/main/templates). For this moment we support two variants of template in two programming languages:
 - JavaScript (Node.js) üëâ [template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/main/templates/template-js)
 - TypeScript (ts-node) üëâ [template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/main/templates/template-ts)

In the following sections we will describe both templates' contents and show you how they can be used in your own project.

## Work with JavaScript (Node.js)

This application package template contains two files:

- **package.json** - this file holds all the important information about the project in plain JSON Object format. It contains human-readable metadata about the project (like the project name and description) as well as functional metadata like the package version number or dependencies required by the application.`package.json` file is one of the basic requirement to have in the root of every project. This is the heart of any Node.js project, used by the application to find its dependencies to install, scripts to run, etc. If you would like to start your project from scratch, without using our js-template, you would need to create a directory and run `npm init` inside. This command would create a `package.json` file for you with all the obligatory properties, for example:

```json
{
  "name": "sample-project",  // the name of the project
  "version": "1.0.0",        // the version of the project
  "description": "",         // a short description of the project
  "main": "index.js",        // the entry point/file of the project
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"  // the script to run tests, you can add more scripts to this object
  },
  "author": "",              // the author of the project
  "license": "ISC"           // the license of the project
}
```

Of course more properties can be added to this object if you need them, such as `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. Dependencies are simply all the other modules that your project will use. In template's `package.json` file there is one more property `"repository"`, which shows the repository address, where the source code of the package is located.

ü§ì If you would like to learn more about configuration in Node.js projects, please refer to the documentation on Node.js [official website](https://nodejs.dev/learn/introduction-to-nodejs).

- **index.js** - this is where you should put your code and all the logic of the application you create. It will be the entry point of your application. In our template we introduce you to a very straight forward application, which simply reads input stream and write it to the output stream.

```js
const { PassThrough } = require("stream");

module.exports = function(input) {
      /*
    THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR CODE, AND ALL THE LOGIC OF YOUR APPLICATION
    We put some code below for demonstration, and also instructions to run this template with scramjet-transform-hub (STH).
    */

    // create a clean output stream
    const out = new PassThrough({encoding: 'utf-8'});

    input.on("data", data => {
       // write some data to the output stream
        out.write(data)
    });
    // return the output stream so it can be consumed (e.g. by CLI client)
    return out;
};
```

And this is what our template app does, it takes any input that will be sent or piped to it and simply writes it to the output stream. Of course you can add some logic to this function, but to keep the template simple we will just write the data to the output stream.

To see how this template works you can run it with a few simple commands:

> :bulb: **Note** You need those two babies installed to run this template: `npm install -g @scramjet/sth @scramjet/cli`


### **open 3 terminals**
### in the 1Ô∏è‚É£ terminal: 
- run command `scramjet-transform-hub`
### in the 2Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:
- `cd templates`
- `si pack template-js`
- `si seq send template-js.tar.gz`
- `si sequence start <sequence-id>`
- `si instance output <instance-id>`

### in the 3Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:
The command below will run the app in the background. The app generates random numbers from 1 to 10 and write them to instance's `/input` endpoint (to instance which will be run on sth). In this way we are sending an input stream that will be consumed by our template app.

- `node ./tools/stream-gen-tool/numbers-gen.js <instance-id>`

### **expected output:**

![template1](../images/template1.png)

What you can see in the attached image is 3 terminals that illustrates the template's workflow:

Terminal :one: shows the logs of running `scramjet-transform-hub` process. 

Terminal :two: shows the output of the program that we launched using STH CLI. 

Terminal :three: shows the output of the `node` command that runs the app which generates random numbers and sends them to the instances's input.

## Work with TypeScript (ts-node)

TypeScript compiles to JavaScript. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means that you can use all the features of JavaScript plus some new features and advantages of TypeScript, then compile it and get regular JavaScript. 

This application package template contains files:

- **package.json** - function of this file is similar to `package.json` file in [JavaScript template](##Work-with-JavaScript-(Node.js)).

- **tsconfig.json** - it is a crucial file for managing your project,it creates itself after running `tsc --init` command, which initializes the TypeScript project. This file is where you can set the compiler options. Basically this is an indicator for TypeScript, which says that the project in which this file lies and all the other sub folders should be managed by TypeScript and it also tells Typescript how to compile all the `*.ts` files in the project.

```typescript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  },
  "include": [
    "./index.ts"
  ]
}
```

:nerd_face:  If you would like to learn more about configuration in TypeScript projects, please refer to the documentation on TypeScript [official website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

- **dist** - this is a folder where the compiled JavaScript files will be stored (`npm run build` - run this script to compile `index.ts` into `index.js`).

- **package-json.lock** - this is automatically generated file, which represent any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

- **index.ts** - this is where you should put your code and all the logic of the application you create. It will be the entry point of your application. 
This file will be compiled into manila JavaScript and stores in `index.js` file in `dist` directory.

In our template we introduce you to a very straight forward application, which simply reads input stream and write it to the output stream.

```typescript
import { ReadableApp } from "@scramjet/types";
import { PassThrough } from "stream";

const app: ReadableApp<string> = async function(input) {
    /*
    THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR CODE, AND ALL THE LOGIC OF YOUR APPLICATION
    We put some code below for demonstration, and also instructions to run this template with scramjet-transform-hub.
    */

    // create a clean output stream
    const outputStream = new PassThrough({ encoding: "utf-8" });

    input.on("data", data => {
        // write some data to the output stream
        outputStream.write(data)
    });
    // return output stream so it can be consumed (e.g. by CLI client)
    return outputStream;
};

export default app;
```

This is the minimal signature for a function that takes a stream and returns a stream.

```typescript
<T,U>(inp: ReadableStream<T>, ...args: any[]) => AnyReadable<U>
```

And this is what our template app does, it takes any input that will be sent or piped to it and simply writes it to the output stream. Of course you can add some logic to this function, but to keep the template simple we will just write the data to the output stream.

To see how this template works you can run it with a few simple commands:

> :bulb: **Note!** You need those two babies installed to run this template:
> `npm install -g @scramjet/sth @scramjet/cli`

### **open 3 terminals**
### in the 1Ô∏è‚É£ terminal: 
- run command `scramjet-transform-hub`
### in the 2Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:
- `cd templates/template-ts`
- `npm run build` - it runs build script in the template's package.json file, which compiles Typescript to JavaScript
- `cp -r node_modules/ package.json dist/` - it copies node_modules and package.json to the dist folder
- `si pack dist` - it creates a tar.gz archive of the dist folder
- `si sequence send dist.tar.gz` - it sends the archive to STH
- `si sequence start <sequence-id>` - it starts the sequence (started sequence turns into instance)
- `si instance output <instance-id>`- it shows the instance's output stream in the terminal

### in the 3Ô∏è‚É£ terminal:
The command below will run the app in the background. The app generates random numbers from 1 to 10 and write them to instance's `/input` endpoint (to instance which will be run on sth). In this way we are sending an input stream that will be consumed by our template app.
