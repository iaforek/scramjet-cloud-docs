# Templates :pencil:

We have prepared for you some templates. User templates allow you to apply predefined settings to start building your own applications. Using templates, you can easily set up multiple applications with similar settings.

You can use it as a base for your own samples ðŸ‘‰ [sample template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/main/templates). For this moment we support two variants of template in two programming languages:
 - JavaScript (Node.js) ðŸ‘‰ [template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/main/templates/template-js)
 - TypeScript (ts-node) ðŸ‘‰ [template](https://github.com/scramjetorg/scramjet-cloud-docs/tree/main/templates/template-ts)

In the following sections we will describe both templates' contents and show you how they can be used in your own project.





## Work with JavaScript (Node.js)

This application package template contains two files:
- index.js - this is where you should put your code and all the logic of the application you create. It will be the entry point of your application.

- package.json

## Work with TypeScript (ts-node)
